# Pokemon game in Turing
My first ever "complete" program, from my grade 11 high school class (1999).
This program is what caused me to get into and love coding, even though it was horribly inefficient, it was gloriously fun!

I updated a little code in 2011 to fix an image issue

A couple of Pokemon things:
* At the character select screen, I now know that is Red, not Ash. Red is cool and awesome. Ash stinks in comparison.
* Sorry Bulbasaur
